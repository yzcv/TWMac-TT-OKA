### Environment Requirements

MATLAB2021a with 

- Parallel Computing Toolbox
- Image Processing Toolbox
- Statistic and Machine Learning toolbox

The code was tested on Windows 10 with Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-9700 CPU @ 3.00GHz.

### Test

- Run 'Demo_91x111x3_Lena.m' for a randomly cropped image Lena of size [91, 111, 3] using TWMac-TT-OKA.
- Run 'TestOKA' for checking the Overlapping Ket Augmentation process.
